To Do
=====
- Implement pull-to-refresh for tableview
- Implement caching: Open Weather Map suggests only 1 call per device per 10 minutes
- Implement CoreLocation calls to look-up current location
- Finish parsing of JSON data into DWWeather model object


Possible UI Enhancments
=======================
- Show cooridinates on map
- Implement auto-completion when typing location name?
- Background image tied to current weather conditions (_a la_ Apple Weather)


Bugs
====
- Sunrise and Sunset times are in GMT rather than local time
- Air Pressure and wind speed are in wrong units
